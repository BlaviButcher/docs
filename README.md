## Setup

You need Hugo version `0.92.2` or later to build the website. See [the Hugo installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) for more details. NPM is also required. If you don't have it already, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a good option for installing and managing node.

Once you have Hugo installed, run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to preview the website at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).
